# Project-management
This is a Django-based project management system that includes user registration, login, project management, task tracking, and commenting functionality. It uses Django REST Framework to expose APIs and includes JWT authentication.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that the following software is installed on your local machine:
1. Python 3.12
2. pip (Python package installer)
3. PostgreSQL or SQLite (depending on your setup)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

cd project-management

```
2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies using Pipenv:
```
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell
pipenv install

```
This will install the required packages, including:

* django: A high-level Python web framework.

4. Migrate the Database

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

```

5. Create a Superuser (Optional)

To create a superuser for accessing the Django admin panel, run:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
